Task brief:

1. Coding Responsively
 
Please create a small responsive web site that contains the following elements: two forms of responsive navigation, and image grid gallery and some contextual content. Below are some further notes on what we are looking for.

Header & Footer
Primary navigation bar with the following link titles;

•	Link 1
•	Link 2
•	Awkward Long link
•	Link 3
•	Link 4

1.	The menu bar should be displayed in a unbroken horizontal line, unless the screen width is too narrow, in which case an expanding container should be used
2.	Create a secondary navigation bar with 8 links (Item 1 to Item 8)
3.	The navigation should remain fixed on page as user scrolls
4.	One of the navigation bars should be displayed off-canvas in a vertical list when it doesn’t fit viewport width

Content area with:

•	A grid of images (at least 8, no upper limit) with random ‘feature’ images that are larger than the standard images. All Images are masked by a rectangle ( width 300px and Height 150px ) with a corner radius of 15px, and a border of 10px. This rectangle has a black drop shadow positioned 5px in the Y 0px in the X and a blur of 10px applied.

•	3 columns of text (lorem ipsum is fine for this) when screen width allows, and a suitable display when the screen width is too narrow
